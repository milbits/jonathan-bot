			'Before I can answer this question, we need to understand what Discord is and it\'s history. Discord is an instant messaging and VoIP social platform which allows communication through voice calls, video calls, text messaging, and media. Communication can be private or take place in virtual communities called "servers".\nThe concept of Discord came from Jason Citron, who had founded OpenFeint, a social gaming platform for mobile games,[13] and Stanislav Vishnevskiy, who had founded Guildwork, another social gaming platform. Citron sold OpenFeint to GREE in 2011 for US$104 million,[14] which he used to found Hammer & Chisel, a game development studio, in 2012.[15] Their first product was Fates Forever, released in 2014, which Citron anticipated to be the first multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game on mobile platforms, but it did not become commercially successful',
